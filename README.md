Excellent — let’s make your **Digital Wallet Project** the anchor portfolio piece that ties together all the skills you need for a senior fintech role. Think of it as a **Stripe-lite meets Venmo-lite** app, showing event-driven design, AI integration, compliance awareness, and cloud-native deployment.

# 🏦 Digital Wallet Project – Senior Portfolio Anchor

## 🎯 High-Level Goal

Build a **scalable, secure, event-driven fintech wallet** with:

- **Core wallet features** (deposit, withdraw, transfer).
- **Double-entry ledger** for financial integrity.
- **Event-driven services** (Kafka or equivalent).
- **AI-powered fraud detection**.
- **Cloud-native deployment with observability**.
- **Compliance-minded design** (audit logs, KYC).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Recommended)

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind (dashboard, user wallet UI) + TypeScript.
- **Backend**: GoLang & Gin.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for ledger + users), Redis (caching).
- **Messaging/Event Bus**: Apache Kafka (or Redpanda/NATS if simpler).
- **Cloud**: AWS (ECS/Lambda/S3/RDS) or GCP equivalent.
- **AI**: Python microservice with scikit-learn or API integration (fraud detection).
- **Infra**: Docker + Kubernetes (later stage).
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry.

---

## 📈 Feature Roadmap

### **Phase 1 – Foundations (Month 1)**

- ✅ User registration + login (JWT + refresh tokens).
- ✅ KYC step: require user to upload ID (simulate with file upload).
- ✅ Wallet creation per user.
- ✅ API gateway + first service (Users Service).

---

### **Phase 2 – Transactions & Ledger (Month 2–3)**

- ✅ Deposit/withdraw money (simulate bank/card API).
- ✅ Transfer between wallets.
- ✅ **Double-entry ledger**:

  - Every transaction creates two entries (debit & credit).
  - Ledger ensures balances stay consistent.

- ✅ Event sourcing:

  - Publish `TransactionInitiated`, `TransactionCompleted`, `TransactionFailed`.
  - Ledger service consumes and updates balances.

- ✅ Audit logs (immutable history).

---

### **Phase 3 – AI Fraud Detection (Month 4)**

- ✅ Train or mock a fraud model (e.g., flag transactions > \$10k from new users).
- ✅ Real-time scoring service:

  - Transaction event → scored → attach risk score.

- ✅ Dashboard: show flagged transactions to admins.
- ✅ Optional: Integrate with OpenAI/HuggingFace API for anomaly detection instead of custom training.

---

### **Phase 4 – Scalability & Observability (Month 5)**

- ✅ Dockerize services + deploy to Kubernetes (minikube locally, AWS later).
- ✅ Add monitoring:

  - Prometheus metrics (transaction volume/sec, error rate).
  - Grafana dashboards.

- ✅ Logging: Centralized logs (ELK stack or OpenSearch).
- ✅ Deployment strategy: Canary or blue/green for fraud service.

---

### **Phase 5 – Polish & Senior-Level Extras (Month 6)**

- ✅ Write ADRs (Architecture Decision Records): why Kafka, why Postgres, why ledger model, etc.
- ✅ Create diagrams: event flow, system design, data model.
- ✅ Add feature flags (e.g., enable/disable fraud detection).
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions → deploy to cloud).
- ✅ Documentation:

  - README (with diagrams + instructions).
  - Blog post: _“How I built an event-driven, AI-powered fintech wallet”_.

---

## 🌟 Stretch Goals (if time allows)

- Integrate **Stripe API** or Plaid sandbox for real bank/payments simulation.
- Add **mobile app** (React Native wrapper around APIs).
- Support **multi-currency wallets** (USD, EUR, BTC).
- Introduce **smart contracts** (Solidity demo for crypto payments).

---

## 📊 Final Deliverables

By Month 6, you’ll have:

1. **GitHub repo** with clean code, Docker/Kubernetes setup, infra as code.
2. **Deployed demo app** (frontend + backend running on cloud).
3. **Fraud detection service** with AI integration.
4. **System diagrams & docs** showing senior-level thinking.
5. **Blog/LinkedIn post** walking through your design decisions.

👉 This project makes you stand out because it directly mirrors **real fintech engineering challenges** (security, compliance, event-driven processing, AI for fraud).

Would you like me to break this down further into a **week-by-week sprint plan** (like agile sprints with goals) so you have a very concrete path?
